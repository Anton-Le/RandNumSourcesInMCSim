# README - Workflows

This directory contains [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) workflows used
for an automated, reproducible generation and processing of data required for this project.

## Workflows

1.  [Coordinate workflow](./coordinateWorkflow)
2.  [Pi workflow](./piWorkflow)

## Prerequisites

To run any of the workflows an up-to-date [Snakemake installation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
is required. Additionally the current repository should be present locally.

Some workflows may require additional packages to be installed to work (i.e., Matplotlib, SciPy etc.).
Please refer to the `Prerequisites` section of the respective workflow's README.
